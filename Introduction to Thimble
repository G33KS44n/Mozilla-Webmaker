Thimble, the new tool that makes it incredibly simple for anyone to create and share their own web pages and other 
projects in minutes.
Thimble is webmaking made easy.
Itâ€™s an intuitive visual editor that lets you write and edit HTML right in your browser,
preview and correct your work, and then publish and share fully functional web pages with a single click.
Thimble removes many of the barriers for novice users trying to learn code, and includes a series of sarter projects 
 and templates to help anyone get started quickly.
