#Popcorn Maker 
Mozilla Popcorn supercharges web video
Popcorn Maker helps you easily remix web video, audio and images into cool mashups that you can embed on other websites.
Popcorn is the result of ongoing collaboration between filmmakers, developers and webmakers. 
Together we explore how modern browser technologies like HTML5 can reshape moving images online.

We focus on three types of users:
Developers
